# 🤖 Film Script Generator AI

Welcome to the **Film Script Generator AI**! This project, developed as part of an artificial neural networks lecture, focuses on creating a **natural language processing (NLP) model** for generating film scripts. The aim is to explore the potential of AI algorithms in the creative process of scriptwriting within the film industry.

---

## 🚀 Features

### 1. **AI-Driven Script Generation**
- Leverages **deep learning techniques** to generate film scripts.
- Integrates a **natural language processing (NLP)** model trained to produce realistic and logical narratives.
- Generates scripts based on input data and produces text outputs resembling professional screenwriting.

### 2. **Realistic and Logical Narratives**
- The AI model focuses on creating scripts that are:
  - **Realistic** - Mimicking human-written film scripts.
  - **Logical** - Ensuring narrative consistency and coherence.
  - **Captivating** - Designed to engage audiences.

### 3. **Epoch Training Demonstration**
- Includes an **epoch-based training demo** that showcases the model's training process.
- Allows users to observe how the AI model improves over training iterations.

### 4. **Input and Output Integration**
- Accepts input training data (text-based film scripts).
- Generates **AI-driven scripts** as output for evaluation.

### 5. **Exploration of Limitations**
- Evaluates the challenges of AI script generation, such as:
  - Emotional depth.
  - Creativity constraints.
